## 🎨 Features

### Current Status: 🚧 In Development (Milestone 8 Complete)

**Lottie Open Studio** is currently under active development.

#### ✅ Working Features:

- 🎨 **Layer Management** - View, select, hide/show, and lock layers
- ⌛ **Timeline Playback** - Play/pause animations with 30 FPS playback engine
- 🎬 **Multi-Property Animation** - Animate position, scale, rotation, opacity, colors, and stroke width
- ⚡ **Easing Functions** - Linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out with visual feedback
- 🎨 **Color Animation** - Smooth RGB interpolation for fill and stroke colors
- 📊 **Property Tracks** - Expandable timeline tracks showing keyframes per property
- 💾 **Lottie Export** - Export animations as standard Lottie JSON format
- 🔄 **Lottie Import** - Import and edit existing Lottie JSON files with full round-trip support
- 📈 **Custom Bezier Curves** - Visual bezier curve editor for custom easing with draggable control points
- 👁️ **Live Preview** - Real-time canvas preview with smooth interpolated animations
- 🧪 **Test Coverage** - 440 tests passing with comprehensive TDD approach
- 🎬 **Lottie Preview** - Live preview with official lottie-web player (SVG/Canvas/HTML renderers)
- 🖥️ **Comparison Mode** - Side-by-side view of editor canvas vs Lottie preview
- 🔍 **Fullscreen Preview** - Immersive preview mode with keyboard shortcuts (F/ESC)
- ⚙️ **Quality Settings** - Preview at 0.5x, 1x, or 2x quality for performance testing
- ⚠️ **Warning System** - Automatic detection of performance and compatibility issues
- 🎞️ **Faithful Imported Playback** - Imported Lottie files play from their original JSON (precomps, images and all) right on the editor canvas — no lossy round-trip

- 🔧 **Fix & Export** - Scans for player-hostile patterns (timing overruns, non-standard keys, missing keyframe starts, NaN/Infinity, dangling assets, out-of-range colors, malformed hex like `#000`), previews the fixed animation live, then exports on approval — see [the changelog](web-editor/CHANGELOG.md) for the full issue list

#### 🚧 In Progress:
- 💾 **Project Save/Load** - Persist projects to local storage with versioning
- 🎨 **Advanced Features** - Text layers, gradients, masks

See [PLAN.web-editor.md](PLAN.web-editor.md) for the complete development roadmap.

## 📦 Project Structure

This repository contains two complementary tools for working with Lottie animations:

### 1. **Lottie Open Studio** (Web Editor) - Main Project
A browser-based animation editor for creating and editing Lottie animations.

**Location**: `web-editor/`
**Status**: 🚧 80% Complete (8/10 milestones to MVP)
**Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand
**Current Features**: SVG import, multi-property animation, Lottie JSON import/export, custom bezier curves

### 2. **Lottie to GIF Converter** (CLI Tool)
✅ Production Ready - Convert Lottie JSON animations to animated GIF files.

**Location**: [`lottie-to-gif/`](lottie-to-gif/)
**Status**: ✅ Stable
**Documentation**: [lottie-to-gif/README.md](lottie-to-gif/README.md)

```bash
# Quick example
cd lottie-to-gif
npm install
npm run build
node bin/lottie-to-gif examples/bond_vector.json
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our convenience scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marciogranzotto/lottie-tools.git
cd lottie-tools

# Setup (installs dependencies)
./setup.sh

# Run the development server
./run.sh
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 to try the editor!

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

Run the project in a containerized environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marciogranzotto/lottie-tools.git
cd lottie-tools

# Development mode (with hot-reload)
docker-compose up lottie-dev

# Production mode (optimized build with nginx)
docker-compose --profile production up lottie-prod
```

**Development**: http://localhost:5173 (hot-reload enabled)
**Production**: http://localhost:8080 (optimized nginx build)

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marciogranzotto/lottie-tools.git
cd lottie-tools/web-editor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm run coverage
```

### Serving on Your LAN (phones, tablets, other computers)

By default Vite only binds to `localhost`. To open the editor from another
device on the same network:

```bash
cd web-editor
npm run dev -- --host
```

Vite prints the LAN URL (e.g. `http://192.168.100.98:5173/lottie-tools/`) —
open it in any browser on that network. If the page won't load from the other
device but works locally, allow Node.js through Windows Firewall (or your
OS equivalent) for private networks.

> Tip: after heavy hot-reload editing sessions, a stale module cache can serve
> broken code. Restart the dev server and hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) if the
> page ever comes up blank.

### CLI Converter (Available Now)

```bash
cd lottie-to-gif
npm install
npm run build

# Convert a Lottie animation to GIF
npx lottie-to-gif animation.json
```

See [lottie-to-gif/README.md](lottie-to-gif/README.md) for full CLI documentation.

## 🗺️ Project Vision

**Lottie Open Studio** aims to be a powerful, open-source alternative for creating and editing Lottie animations directly in the browser. By combining a user-friendly web editor with a robust CLI converter, we're building a complete toolkit for working with Lottie animations.

**Why Lottie?**
- Vector animations that scale without quality loss
- Small file sizes compared to GIF/video
- Interactive and programmable
- Cross-platform (web, iOS, Android, React Native)
